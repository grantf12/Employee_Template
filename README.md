## Description:
Use this template to generate an HTML that can be used to keep track of your team by using an emplyees' Name, ID, and Email. Each person is assigned a role and is given a different prompt to reflect their role. After the employee has entered all of their information they are asked if they would like to add another employee to the team. If so they are given the prompt that asks for their role. If they are done the application will push the team's information to create a new HTML that can be found in the 'output' folder.
